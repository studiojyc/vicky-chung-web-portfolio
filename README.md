Hi! This is where the magic happens at Studio JYC, a multidisciplinary studio built on the intersection between culture and design. 

At the moment, we are helping others create special experiences through front-end web development and visual design. However, we know there is still so much to learn. By documenting our process on Github, we hope to improve from each project we work on as well as provide guidance for those in a similar place as us. 

You can get in touch with us either through our email, studiojunyangchin@gmail.com or by interacting with us on Instagram @studiojyc.
